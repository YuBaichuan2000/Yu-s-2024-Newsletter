## January
This month is huge! I am finally back at home for Chinese lunar new year since 2020. Still very busy practicing leetcode questions 
and frontend web development side projects. However, I can sense improvements after practicing for two months which definitely gives me confidence and more fuel. 
Had a little conversation with my dad after he's a bit tipsy. 

#### Things I learnt:
1. Please try your best to avoid get-rich-quick schemes. They come in different forms, so tricky.
2. Family over fame and wealth, family gives you sense of belonging. Family is number one.
3. Have a goal and work towards it everyday. Do not drain yourself and do not stop. Let time do its magic.

## Febuary
I am back in Adelaide from home. The first week was pretty intense, getting myself settled down. I drove Larissa's new Prado back to Adelaide.
Can feel lots of support from her family which cheers me on. I am on the road again finding paid interns or jobs, I will do it! Getting a bit left behind on 
Leetcode, need more practice on various questions, especially Dynamic Programming.

#### Things I learnt:
1. Whatever you do, there is a way to success, be creative and stand out from others.
2. Property development is not your gold mine, dive deeper into IT.
3. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT INTERNET.
4. Try cope with people you do not like. You have to do it from time to time anyways.
