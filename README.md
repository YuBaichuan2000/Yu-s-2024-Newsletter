## January
This month is huge! I am finally back at home for Chinese lunar new year since 2020. Still very busy practicing leetcode questions 
and frontend web development side projects. However, I can sense improvements after practicing for two months which definitely gives me confidence and more fuel. 
Had a little conversation with my dad after he's a bit tipsy. 

#### Things I learnt:
1. Please try your best to avoid get-rich-quick schemes. They come in different forms, so tricky.
2. Family over fame and wealth, family gives you sense of belonging. Family is number one.
3. Have a goal and work towards it everyday. Do not drain yourself and do not stop. Let time do its magic.

## Febuary
I am back in Adelaide from home. The first week was pretty intense, getting myself settled down. I drove Larissa's new Prado back to Adelaide.
Can feel lots of support from her family which cheers me on. I am on the road again finding paid interns or jobs, I will do it! Getting a bit left behind on 
Leetcode, need more practice on various questions, especially Dynamic Programming.

#### Things I learnt:
1. Whatever you do, there is a way to success, be creative and stand out from others.
2. Property development is not your gold mine, dive deeper into IT.
3. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT INTERNET.
4. Try cope with people you do not like. You have to do it from time to time anyways.

## April
I don't know what happened but I missed a month. Obviously, I got rejected on many applications and nothing worked out so far. I haven't applied any new positions for quite a while which is not good at all. Will get back to it once I updated my resume. I don't know if I am squandering my time but I picked up golf and I am hitting with others for 40 bucks. I did not spend much time on web development or school work. Reading books at the moment and it kind of made me anxious. Those guys seem like born to know how to make money and I still have no clue and I am nearly 24. I reckon I picked a path which sort of interests me and have wealthy potential. Maybe I need to start drilling deep. But that is just time gone and door shut for other opportunities. Don't have many connections, so I guess I have to invest in myself and attract connections at this stage. Just get really good at what you do.

#### Things I learnt:
1. Spend more time on decisions and less time on actions!
2. My hourly rate is 100/hr
3. Don't count otherwise you get anxious
4. Put in daily work
5. Happiness is a skill that you can practice from now on. Money does not solve happiness problem only money problem.
6. Learn fundamentals, how to keep happy family relationships, try building a youtube channel starting from DB, learn some real estate before buying. Learn negotiation and sale.
