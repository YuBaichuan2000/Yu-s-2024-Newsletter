## January
This month is huge! I am finally back at home for Chinese lunar new year since 2020. Still very busy practicing leetcode questions 
and frontend web development side projects. However, I can sense improvements after practicing for two months which definitely gives me confidence and more fuel. 
Had a little conversation with my dad after he's a bit tipsy. 

#### Things I learnt:
1. Please try your best to avoid get-rich-quick schemes. They come in different forms, so tricky.
2. Family over fame and wealth, family gives you sense of belonging. Family is number one.
3. Have a goal and work towards it everyday. Do not drain yourself and do not stop. Let time do its magic.
